## Chatter
This is a very simple chatting application inspired by [this](https://css-tricks.com/build-a-chat-app-using-react-hooks-in-100-lines-of-code/) article and using Akash Joshi's modified chat server.

## How to run
1. Clone this repository
2. By default, server runs at http://localhost:8081. Create a .env file into chatter-front directory and put that address as variable REACT_APP_API_URL.
3. Go to socket-server directory and run npm start
4. Go to chatter-front directory and run npm start
5. Have fun!
